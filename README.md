## Description

_I created a Java project for my B.S. in Software Engineering that manages hotel bookings for the Landon Hotel. The user is greeted with a welcome message both in French and English. The messages are accomplished through the use of threads. The customer can select dates they would like to book, which dynamically loads the rooms available, along with their prices in USD, CAD, and EUR. Developing this application helped me grow my understanding of Java, front-end development, and Docker._
